torbrowser-overlay

Torbrowser without Vidalia or Tor
https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en

This patched firefox build is _NOT_ recommended by Tor upstream but uses
the exact same patches. Use this only if you know what you are doing!

The profile moved to '~/.mozilla/torbrowser'. It's auto generated
and manually copying isn't necessary anymore.
		
This profile folder includes pre-configuration recommended by upstream,
as well as the extensions Torbutton, NoScript and HTTPS-Everywhere.
If you want to start from scratch just remove the directory '~/.mozilla/torbrowser'.

Torbrowser uses port 9150 to connect to Tor. You can change the port
in the connection settings to match your setup."

The torbroser-overlay isn't in layman's list of overlays.
To add it manually, append
https://raw.github.com/MeisterP/torbrowser-overlay/master/torbrowser-overlay.xml
to the overlays section in '/etc/layman/layman.cfg'.
With newer versions of layman, you can put the file into '/etc/layman/overlays/'.
