torbrowser-overlay

Torbrowser without vidalia or tor
https://www.torproject.org/projects/torbrowser.html.en

This patched firefox build is _NOT_ recommended by TOR upstream but uses
the exact same patches (excluding Vidalia-patch). Use this only if you know
what you are doing!

Copy the folder contents from '/usr/share/torbrowser/profile' (installed by
www-misc/torbrowser-profile) into '~/.torbrowser/profile'.
		
This profile folder includes pre-configuration recommended by upstream,
as well as the extensions Torbutton, NoScript and HTTPS-Everywhere.
If you want to start from scratch just create the directories '~/.torbrowser/profile'.

The update check when you first start torbrowser may not recognize this version.

The torbroser-overlay isn't in layman's list of overlays.
To add it manually, append
https://raw.github.com/MeisterP/torbrowser-overlay/master/torbrowser-overlay.xml
to the overlays section in '/etc/layman/layman.cfg'.
With newer versions of layman, you can put the file into '/etc/layman/overlays/'.
